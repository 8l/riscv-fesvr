This repository contains the front-end server library, which facilitates
communication between a host machine and a RISC-V target machine.  It is
usually not meant to be used as a standalone package.

Execute the following commands to install the library, assuming you've
declared the RISCV environment variable to point to the RISC-V install path:

On BWTC machines
% export PATH=/tools/xilinx/SDK/2013.4/gnu/arm/lin/bin:$PATH
% mkdir build
% cd build
% ../configure --host=arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi
% make -j
